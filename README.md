# Some Arch Linux packages

The contents of this repository (excluding upstream packages sources
where they're included) is released into the public domain (with the
exception of boxbackup-server and boxbackup-client, which were submitted
to the AUR [by wabi](https://aur.archlinux.org/account/wabi) and patched
by me). Note that this doesn't imply anything about the licenses of the
packaged software.
